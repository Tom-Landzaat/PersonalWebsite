                <!--Provide a detailed explanation of what the project is about, its purpose, and who it is for.-->
                    <p>This Robotic Arm was a team based project for a Junior Design class. We were given certain engineering
                        requirements such as affordability, speed, precision and SCARA topology. From there we were free
                        to attempt any approach we liked and we chose servos to move the arm. The system takes in G-code inputs 
                        or cursor movements and performs the respective movement. For this project we used 
                        an ESP32-WROOM-32D, a custom PCB designed in KiCad, an adjustable 3A buck converter and 3D-printed
                        arms, joints and an enclosure. </p>

                    <h3><b>How</b></h3>
                <!--Describe how the project was accomplished, the tools and technologies used, and the overall process.-->
                    <p> For this project we divided the project up into 6 blocks and assigned each team member 2 blocks. 
                        From there, each team member made the documentation and validated the inputs and outputs for each block.
                        Once validation was complete we began building and assembling the blocks which included a code/microcontroller 
                        block, power delivery PCB block, Mechanical block and other smaller blocks. The arms were designed in Fusion360 
                        and printed with PLA. The code block contained all the inverse kinematics calculations to convert the position we
                        wanted the drawing utensil to be at, into angles of each servo (base and elbow servo). The code also included wifi 
                        connectivity such that we could communicate over a port on the same WiFi network. For example, someone could run 
                        our python GUI script and send g-codes on the port that the microcontroller was listening on. We extended this 
                        principle to the drawing window where we allow users to sketch with their cursor; all cursor locations on the 
                        window are translated to g-code commands and sent to the microcontroller in the same fashion.

                <!--Share insights, challenges faced, lessons learned, and potential improvements for the future.-->
                    <p> After completing the team project and achieving all engineering requirements we had a few ideas for what
                        we might change if we were to start again from scratch. For starters, servos did okay in our application, 
                        however, they have some slop between the gears which leads to more inaccuracies  the farther the arm is from 
                        zero. Stepper motors and belts could have helped us in this scenario as we could reduce the weight on each 
                        arm as well as changing the gearing ratio for adjusting speed and control. Other things we learned was that 
                        documentation of each block and good communication with peers working on neighboring blocks is crucial for 
                        seamless system integration. However, despite some challenges along the way, we as a team had a lot of fun in
                        the design and testing of the arm and are very proud of the final product.
