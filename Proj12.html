                <!--Provide a detailed explanation of what the project is about, its purpose, and who it is for.-->
                    <p>
                        This assembly project included two boards and was programmed in AVR assembly. The goal was to 
                        play a game of rock paper scissors between the two devices, one for each user but with a little 
                        twist. The twist was you shoot two hands at once, show your opponent and see their two hands, then 
                        together pick which hand you wanted to throw. For example, if I threw <code>rock and paper</code> 
                        and the opponent also chose <code>paper and rock</code>, I would throw paper that way I win if they 
                        throw <code>rock</code>, or we tie if they throw <code>paper</code>.

                    <h3><b>How</b></h3>
                <!--Describe how the project was accomplished, the tools and technologies used, and the overall process.-->
                    <p> This was accomplished by installing jumper wires between the respective transmit and receive pins of each 
                        board and setting up the same USART format. This includes the same baud rate, same number of stop bits 
                        and data bits, what parity mode to use and for extra usability we enabled the interrupt when a receive was 
                        complete. Upon successful transmit and receive we needed to encode the two hands from each player to the other. 
                        To do this we declared rock = 0, paper = 1 and scissors = 2. For transmitting, we bit shifted the left hand by 
                        two effectively storing the left hand in bits 3 and 2 while the right hand was added to the total resulting in 
                        right hand being stored in bits 1 and 0. Once the other board received this data they could andi bits 1 and 0 for 
                        the right hand and bit shift right by two then andi bits 1 and 0 to get the left hand. This resulted in efficient 
                        USART communication. To transmit the hand choice a simple 1 or 0 would determine left or right hand.

                    <h3><b>Reflection</b></h3>
                <!--Share insights, challenges faced, lessons learned, and potential improvements for the future.-->
                    <p>This project provided hands-on experience with USART protocol and a bigger multi-board assembly
                        project. Being a fairly large project for our scale it came with some challenges such as register 
                        overlap and needed to ensure registers were pushed and popped to the stack in all functions possible.
                        Futhermore, we initially took a polling approach for button presses however, we realized we could not
                        poll for both buttons and the timer/counter flag which served as a countdown on user input. Therefore an 
                        easier future approach includes starting with a interrupt system for the push buttons. If I did this 
                        project again I would try to keep the project more contained as I would be better planned and create 
                        better naming systems and build more modular code blocks
