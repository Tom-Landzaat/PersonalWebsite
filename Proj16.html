                    <h3><b>What</b></h3>
                <!--Provide a detailed explanation of what the project is about, its purpose, and who it is for.-->
                    <p>To actually implement this program, the Shop class was defined to be the primary 
                        object on which most of the operations are performed. The Shop class has data 
                        members that store all the important information about the Shop, including name, 
                        phone, and address, as well as its Menu, and a history of its Orders. Menu is a 
                        class itself, and each Menu object contains an integer representing the number of 
                        things on the Menu, and a pointer to an array of Coffee objects. An object of the 
                        Coffee class represents one single drink (like an Americano) with small, medium, 
                        and large prices as data members. An Order class was also defined, which stores 
                        information about a single transaction that was made, including the number of 
                        drinks and total cost. Many methods were written to help these separate classes 
                        interact and ultimately provide the overall desired functionality.</p>

                <!--Describe how the project was accomplished, the tools and technologies used, and the overall process.-->
                    <p>The main focus of this assignment was to learn to implement classes in C++, by creating 
                        basic implementations of private data members, public get/set methods, and the "Big 3" 
                        (copy constructor, destructor, and assignment overload operator). This assignment 
                        required you to use these principles to simulate a Coffee shop, allowing the user to 
                        place and log orders, add items to the menu, keep track of revenue, and read and write 
                        information to files. The "Big 3" were necessary for the classes that allocate dynamic 
                        memory, including the Shop and Menu classes.</p>

                    <h3><b>Reflection</b></h3>
                <!--Share insights, challenges faced, lessons learned, and potential improvements for the future.-->
                    <p>This program required a lot of proper planning to ensure the program implemented the 
                        classes correctly. I could have saved some time debugging inconsistencies in the 
                        output near the end of the project if I had a more thorough plan of how the 
                        components would interact, however, from that I learned how to better plan and 
                        better understand classes in C++. Furthermore, the dynamic memory allocation for 
                        the orders being placed posed an extra challenge as we had to make sure to free 
                        the memory and in the proper order, ie child then parent.
